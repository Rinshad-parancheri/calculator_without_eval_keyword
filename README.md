# Calculator Project

This calculator project is part of The Odin Project's web development curriculum. The goal is to build a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to implement a basic calculator that can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It should be built without using the `eval()` function or the `new Function()` constructor for security reasons.

### Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

### Safety Warning
It's crucial to avoid using the `eval()` function and the `new Function()` constructor due to security vulnerabilities associated with evaluating potentially unsafe or malicious code. The project aims to provide a solution that doesn't rely on these functions, ensuring a safer implementation.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into three main components:

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure of the calculator interface.
2. **CSS**: Styles the HTML elements for a visually appealing user interface.
3. **JavaScript**: Implements the calculator's functionalities without using `eval()` or `new Function()`.

### How to Contribute
If you're looking to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your contributions.
4. Make your changes or additions.
5. Test thoroughly to ensure the calculator functions correctly and safely.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request to the original repository, explaining your changes.

### Usage
To use the calculator:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the buttons to perform arithmetic operations.

### Notes
This project should serve as a safe and functional implementation of a basic calculator without relying on the potentially dangerous `eval()` function or `new Function()` constructor.

 Please refer to the project guidelines and best practices outlined by The Odin Project before making contributions or implementing the calculator functionalities.
